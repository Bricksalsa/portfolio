  <!-- START: Project text (prefilled) -->
  <p>At Motion Experience, an immersive museum in Eindhoven focused on light, projection, and  spatial storytelling, I worked as an intern on several interactive installations. My tasks ranged  from designing and implementing control systems to creating animations and experimenting with  audience-triggered interactions.     This internship allowed me to deepen my understanding of how technology and scenography  intersect. I explored tools like VJ software and sensor-based inputs to enhance how people  move through and engage with space. It was a hands-on opportunity to approach immersive  experience design from both an aesthetic and a technical angle, and it confirmed my interest in  working on large-scale, multi-sensory environments.     5.Motion  Experience Date: 2022   Materials: Light, Projection, Product design This site-specific intervention took place at  Tuinvereniging Streven naar Verbetering in  Rotterdam, for Rotterdam Architecture Month.  On arrival, I noticed a striking contradiction: a  tall, closed fence protecting the space, while  just behind it stood a sign reading “Everybody  Welcome.” This tension—between invitation  and exclusion—became the core of the work.     I recreated a section of a nearby prison wall  and designed posters inspired by local signage. Each poster subtly rephrased or questioned the garden association’s messaging,  playing with the visual codes of the neighbor hood. Over four hours, I performed as a worker, pasting these posters onto the wall in layers.  The act was both repetitive and disruptive,  gradually building a visual noise that unsettled  the clarity of the original message.     The performance unfolded slowly, allowing space for casual conversations with passersby, some of whom lived nearby or had a  connection to the garden. Their questions and  reactions became part of the work—turning the  piece into a kind of local scenography, where  the environment, community, and performer  continuously shaped each other.     This work asks: What does it mean to be  open, and who decides that openness? How  do fences, signs, and repetition subtly guide  behavior and perception? And how can we  reimagine community spaces in a way that  doesn’t sacrifice safety for inclusion, or vice  versa?Iedereen welkom m.u.v  bestemmingsverkeer 6. Date: 2024   Dimensions: Site-specific, 6m wall +  posters   Materials: Wood, printed posters, tape,  performance This ongoing project began with a simple mechanical curiosity: insert a coin, receive a brief glimpse. But the peepshwow soon became a  tool for research—testing how framing, spectatorship, and subversion function across different contexts.     I experimented with maquettes, site placement, light filters, and access mechanics, always circling around the same question: What do  people expect to see when they look through a frame? And what happens when that expectation is broken?     These experiments evolved into Biecht—a coin-operated setup where participants kneel and view the phrase “What did you expect to  find?” Moments later, they are photographed, and a speculative, AI-generated reflection based on their image is printed on a receipt.  This twist—the “and then” moment—transforms the viewer into the viewed, reframing the interaction from spectacle to self-confrontation.     The peepshow has become a flexible scenographic device in my practice: part installation, part performer, part interface. It stages expectation and destabilizes it, exploring the boundaries between privacy and exposure, control and surrender. This piece is not just about  looking—it’s about being caught looking, and realizing the system is looking back.7.Peepshow  exploration Date: 2024–ongoing   Dimensions: Variable   Materials: Coin mechanism, custom housing, screens, filters,  AI-generated text, camera, printer Blocked Throat is an installation that stages a breakdown. It begins with calm familiarity—a meditative display of radio  wave-generated light patterns invites  passive observation. After a few minutes,  viewers are asked to give feedback. A microphone is placed prominently, offering  a clear next step: speak. But when they  do, their voice is captured and returned to  them as fragmented, distorted noise.     The work draws on principles from product  design, where good systems guide users seamlessly from perception to action.  I mimic this logic to build trust—only to  rupture it. The microphone, an object that  normally promises agency and clarity, be comes a site of failure. It doesn’t silence; it  interrupts, rendering communication difficult, even absurd.     This moment—the “And Then”—is the core  of the piece. Viewers realize the system they trusted is unreliable. The breakdown  is not a bug but the message. It forces  participants to question not only what  they’re experiencing, but how they expect  systems to behave.     Rather than providing answers, Blocked  Throat creates friction. It critiques how pre dictability is engineered into our daily interactions—from digital platforms to public  services—conditioning us to expect control  and efficiency. Here, disruption becomes  a tool to expose that conditioning, inviting  a confrontation with the limits of expectation, agency, and the invisible contracts  we enter when we interact with systems.LINK TO VIDEO FOR MICROPHONE PART: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV6P4WP07Hs 8.Blocket  throat Date: 2024   Dimensions: Variable   Materials: Installation with light, microphone, real-time audio processing,  generative sound thankyou.
