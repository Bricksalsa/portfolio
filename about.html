        <p>I make systems that misbehave.</p>

        <p>My work constructs interactions that appear intuitive, only to unravel. Rooted in scenography and shaped by a background in industrial design, I treat space, interfaces, and objects as scripts: they invite trust, suggest logic, and offer a sense of control. But that control is always fragile, and its collapse is where the work begins.</p>

        <p>At the core of my practice is a fascination with spectatorship, mediation, and the illusion of agency. I am drawn to the moment when the frame becomes visible: when a familiar system glitches, a gaze is returned, or a structure turns on its user. These ruptures reveal the hidden dynamics that shape how we see, how we are seen, and how perception is structured.</p>

        <p>My installations and digital works often pose as something recognizable: a confessional, a vending machine, a surveillance feed. Participants enter expecting clarity or transaction. But the setup twists. What was meant to guide begins to obstruct. What felt private becomes exposed. A coin is inserted, and the system looks back. Meaning emerges not from resolution, but from disorientation.</p>

        <p>This is not about spectacle, but about framing failure. I design for friction. I build systems that can break, and in doing so, expose the control mechanisms embedded within them. I want the viewer to feel implicated: to realize their presence is part of the apparatus, and that the act of looking is never passive, never neutral.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, my work asks: What happens when you think you’re in control, and then you’re not?</p>
